## Description
"Last of the Survivors" is an engaging action game with rogue-lite elements, where your choices can empower you to overcome hordes of attacking monsters. 

## Gameplay

In Last of the Survivors, the player's goal is to survive against the advancing waves of enemies. At the beginning, the player has only one weapon to fight the enemies. By killing enemies, the player gains experience and can level up, which allows you to get additional weapons and passive items or improve existing equipment to cope with the impending greater danger.
